## These are some additional resources that I loved to visit and re-visit while I was learning about Bash and Linux. Keep adding new resources if you come across any new resources!

1. https://www.linux.org/forums/linux-beginner-tutorials.123/ (The official Linux website with forums for all kinds of tutorials)
2. https://youtu.be/gd7BXuUQ91w (The video by NetworkChuck which helped me a lot in getting to know my terminal and commands)
3. https://youtu.be/oxuRxtrO2Ag (This tutorial by Joe Collins is my absolute favourite since it introduces some pretty basic commands)
4. https://youtu.be/ZtqBQ68cfJc (Another commands tutorial by the mighty FreeCodeCamp)
5. https://youtu.be/tK9Oc6AEnR4 (A super cool Bash scripting tutorial by FreeCodeCamp which came out 2 weeks ago as of 27th April, 2023)
6. https://youtu.be/SPwyp2NG-bE (Another video tutorial by NetworkChuck for Bash scripting)

Feel free to keep adding resources as you find them! Let others know what you think too!
